| Delivery | `delivery@fe.com` | `Del@123` |

---

### ✅ PHASE 3 — Real Data Import from Excel

**Goal**: Import 3,218 live consignment records from the business's updated Excel tracker.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Parsed `2026 New Franch Express Tracker.xls` (AWB Tracker sheet) | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Cleared previously imported data | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Filtered rows — skipped any without valid AWB numbers | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Auto-generated sequential SNOs: `FE-0001` → `FE-3218` | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Batch-imported 3,218 consignment documents (500 docs/batch) | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Updated Firestore `/counters/bookingCounter` document to `3218` | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 4 — Firestore Security Rules

**Goal**: Protect the database with role-based access control rules.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Designed `firestore.rules` with `isAdmin()`, `isEmployee()`, `isAuth()` functions | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Applied rules: Employees can create/update consignments, Admins can delete | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Provided deploy instructions for Firebase Console | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 5 — Firestore Read Optimisation (50K Free Tier Limit Fix)

**Problem**: The dashboard was fetching all consignments on every page load, burning through the free Firestore tier's 50,000 daily reads limit with a single user.

**Goal**: Redesign data-fetching architecture to be extremely read-efficient.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Created `/app/api/consignments/stats/route.js` — dedicated stats API | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Used Firestore `count()` aggregation queries for KPIs (1 read per count instead of N reads) | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Added 5-minute server-side cache (module-level) on the stats API | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static rendering | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Updated `/app/api/consignments/route.js` — default 30-day window + cursor-based pagination (limit=50) | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Updated `/app/api/consignments/[id]/route.js` — cache invalidation on write (PUT/DELETE) | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Updated `/hooks/useConsignments.js` — added `fetchDashboardStats()` and `loadMoreConsignments()` | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Updated `/app/dashboard/page.jsx` — calls `fetchDashboardStats()` instead of full collection fetch | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Updated `/app/dashboard/delivery/page.jsx` — passes today's date filter | ✅ Done |

**Estimated Read Reduction**: ~99.96% fewer Firestore reads on dashboard load.

---

### ✅ PHASE 6 — Next.js Viewport Metadata Warning Fix

**Problem**: Build logs showed warnings on every page:
```
⚠ Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export. Please move it to viewport export instead.
```

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Moved `viewport` config out of `metadata` export in `app/layout.jsx` | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Created separate `export const viewport = { width: 'device-width', initialScale: 1 }` | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 7 — GitHub Repository Setup & Vercel Deployment

**Problem**: Vercel Hobby plan blocks deployments from private GitHub repos not owned by the deploying account.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Created GitHub org `GemmatERP` | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Pushed repo to `https://github.com/GemmatERP/franchexpress-erp` | ✅ Done |

| 7 | Aliased production URL to custom domain `https://shipments.gemmat.net` | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 8 — Next.js Build Error Fix (Dynamic Server Usage)

**Problem**: Vercel's build pipeline threw:
```
Stats API Error: Dynamic server usage: Route /api/consignments/stats couldn't be rendered
statically because it accessed `request.headers`.
```
Root cause: `route.js` files were cross-importing each other (e.g., `[id]/route.js` imported `stats/route.js`), causing Next.js static analysis to try to pre-render the stats endpoint at build time.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Created `/lib/stats-cache.js` — a dedicated shared module for cache state | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Exported `getCachedStats()`, `setCachedStats()`, `invalidateStatsCache()` from shared module | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Refactored `stats/route.js` to import from `lib/stats-cache.js` (removed inline state variables) | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Refactored `consignments/route.js` — changed import from `./stats/route` to `../../../lib/stats-cache` | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Refactored `consignments/[id]/route.js` — same import fix | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all 3 route files | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Verified local `npm run build` — clean build, all 11 pages generated without errors | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 9 — Vercel Speed Insights & Analytics Integration

| 2 | Installed `@vercel/analytics` package | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Imported `<SpeedInsights />` from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` in `app/layout.jsx` | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Imported `<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics/next` in `app/layout.jsx` | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Rendered both components inside the `<body>` tag of `RootLayout` | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Committed all changes and pushed to GitHub | ✅ Done |
| 7 | Deployed final build to Vercel production (`npx vercel --prod --yes`) | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Verified live site at `https://shipments.gemmat.net` loads correctly | ✅ Done |

---

### ✅ PHASE 10 — FranchExpress API Scheduled Auto-Sync & Tracking Timeline

**Goal**: Implement an automatic background sync system using Vercel Cron to fetch live shipment updates from the FranchExpress tracking API and display a detailed tracking timeline in the ERP.

## ⚠️ Known / Pending Items

---

### 1. 📱 WhatsApp Integration — Permanent System User Token

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Partially built — notification code exists but token is expired/temporary

**Background**:  
The WhatsApp Business API integration was partially implemented in `lib/notifications.js` to send automated shipment status notifications to consignees. A temporary 24-hour access token was used during development, which has likely expired by now.

**What's Working**:
- `lib/notifications.js` — notification dispatch logic is built
- `app/api/notify/route.js` — API endpoint accepts `consigneePhone`, `awbNumber`, `consigneeName`, `deliveryStatus`
- Called automatically when delivery status is updated

**What's Needed**:
1. Log in to [Meta Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) using the business account
2. Navigate to **WhatsApp → Configuration → System Users**
3. Create or locate the **System User** (not a personal user)
4. Generate a **Permanent Token** with `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   WHATSAPP_TOKEN=your_permanent_system_token_here
   WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID=your_phone_number_id_here
   WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_waba_id_here
   ```
6. Redeploy to Vercel and update the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

**Important**: Never commit the token to GitHub. The repo is public, so `.env.local` must stay gitignored (it already is).

---

### 2. 🔒 npm Audit Vulnerabilities — 21 Security Issues

**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Non-blocking for functionality, but should be addressed

**Summary**: `npm audit` reported:
- 18 Moderate
- 2 High  
- 1 Critical

**How to inspect**:
```bash
cd /Users/mk-mac/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/franchexpress-erp
npm audit
```

**Safe fixes (non-breaking)**:
```bash
npm audit fix
```

**Aggressive fixes (may break things — test after)**:
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

**Recommended approach**:
1. Run `npm audit` first to read the full report
2. Identify which package has the **critical** vulnerability
3. Check if the vulnerable package has a patched version — update it in `package.json`
4. Run `npm run build` after fixing to confirm nothing broke
5. Re-deploy

> Most vulnerabilities in Next.js projects come from transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies). If the fix requires breaking changes, you may need to wait for the upstream package maintainer to release a patch.

---

### 3. 🛡️ Firestore Security Rules Deployment

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Rules file exists locally — needs manual deployment to Firebase

**Background**:  
The `firestore.rules` file was written and reviewed, but deployment to the live Firebase project requires either the Firebase CLI or the Firebase Console. Since the Spark (free) plan was used, the CLI may need re-authentication.

**Rules Summary** (in `firestore.rules`):
- `/consignments/{id}` — **Read**: any authenticated user | **Create/Update**: Employee or Admin | **Delete**: Admin only
- `/users/{uid}` — **Read**: own profile or Admin | **Write**: Admin only
- `/counters/{doc}` — **Read/Write**: Employee or Admin

**Option A — Firebase Console (Easiest, No CLI needed)**:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Select `franchexpress-erp` project
2. Navigate to **Build → Firestore Database → Rules tab**
3. Copy-paste the contents of [`firestore.rules`](file:///Users/mk-mac/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/franchexpress-erp/firestore.rules)
4. Click **Publish**

**Option B — Firebase CLI**:
```bash
npx -y firebase-tools@latest login
npx firebase use franchexpress-erp
npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

> ⚠️ Without deploying these rules, the Firestore database is potentially using the default **open rules** (`allow read, write: if true`) which exposes all data publicly.

---

### 4. 🖼️ Favicon

**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved — favicon configured using `Logo-GM-FE.png` in `app/layout.jsx`

The `Logo-GM-FE.png` is now referenced in `app/layout.jsx` `icons` metadata. No further action needed.

---

### 5. 📦 GitHub Remote URL Warning (Minor)

**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Informational — git pushes still work correctly

**Problem**:  
Every `git push` shows:
```
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   https://github.com/GemmatERP/franchexpress-erp.git
To https://github.com/MK5169/franchexpress-erp.git
```

This is because the remote URL in the local git config still points to the old `MK5169` account URL instead of the new `GemmatERP` org URL.

**Fix**:
```bash
cd /Users/mk-mac/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/franchexpress-erp
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GemmatERP/franchexpress-erp.git
```

Verify with:
```bash
git remote -v
```

---

### 6. 🔄 Scheduled Auto-Sync & Tracking Timeline

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Planned & Analyzed — Implementation Plan ready (Scheduler-based)

**Background**:  
The business needs to track the latest delivery status from the FranchExpress tracking API (`POST https://franchexpress.com/proxy.php`) for all pending consignments in Firestore and display a detailed tracking timeline to users.

**What's Planned**:
1. Add Vercel Cron configuration (`vercel.json`) to run the sync automatically at night (e.g. 2:00 AM UTC).
2. Create secure endpoint `/api/consignments/sync` verifying `CRON_SECRET`.
3. Save detailed execution metrics in `/sync_logs` Firestore collection.
4. Add a `/dashboard/sync` logs page to show recent sync runs and support manually triggering sync.
5. Enhance tracking modal to show live tracking status timeline.

---

### 7. 🔐 CRON_SECRET Environment Variable

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Required for production auto-sync to work

The `/api/consignments/sync` endpoint is protected by a `CRON_SECRET` environment variable. Add it in Vercel:
1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add `CRON_SECRET` with a long random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`)
3. Redeploy

The Vercel Cron job in `vercel.json` passes this secret automatically via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
